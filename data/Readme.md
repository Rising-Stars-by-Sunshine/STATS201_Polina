### The data for the machine learning algorithm was taken from the following research:
Horne, Benjamin D., and Sibel Adali. "This Just In: Fake News Packs a Lot in Title, Uses Simpler, Repetitive Content in Text Body, More Similar to Satire than Real News." NECO 2017
https://github.com/BenjaminDHorne/fakenewsdata1

### There are two datasets: Buzzfeed Political News and Random Political News.

The first dataset contains news' body and titles in plain text files initially investigated by Craig Silverman of Buzzfeed News in the article " This Analysis Shows How Viral Fake Election News Stories Outperformed Real News On Facebook." 

The second dataset consists of randomly collected news' body and titles in plain text files from three source categories in 2016. The sources mentioned by the authors of the original study:
- Real: Wall Street Journal, The Economist, BBC, NPR, ABC, CBS, USA Today, The Guardian, NBC, The Washington Post
- Satire: The Onion, Huffington Post Satire, Borowitz Report, The Beaverton, Satire Wire, and Faking News
- Fake: Ending The Fed, True Pundit, abcnews.com.co, DC Gazette, Liberty Writers News, Before its News, InfoWars, Real News Right Now

Both datasets feature data from 2016 U.S. election period.

### Dictionary:
- Fake: news' body and titles that are known to be false and come from unreliable sources and/or have the intention to mislead the reader (Horne 2017, 2)
- Real: news' body and titles that are known to be true and come from reliable sources (Horne 2017, 2)
