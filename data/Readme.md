### The data for the machine learning algorithm was taken from the following research:
Horne, Benjamin D., and Sibel Adali. "This Just In: Fake News Packs a Lot in Title, Uses Simpler, Repetitive Content in Text Body, More Similar to Satire than Real News." NECO 2017

### There are two datasets: Buzzfeed Political News and Random Political News.
